# Secure Payment Confirmation (SPC)-Enabled dApp


## ðŸ’¡ Idea

SPC is a browser native API that is designed to streamline payments on the web. It's purpose is to streamline the UX for
authneticating users across merchants (in web3 think dApps) whilst verifiying cryptographically that the user can pay
for a transaction with their payment provider (think wallet). The protocol is built on-top of webauthn in order to 
provide the cryptographic proof that the user indeed is the one that initiated the transaction.

## The Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
/
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ pages/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ index.astro
â””â”€â”€ package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |
